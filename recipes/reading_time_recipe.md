1. Describe the problem

> As a user
> So that I can manage my time
> I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can reads 200 words per minute.


2. Design the method signature

> reading_time = reading_time_calculation()

3. Create examples as tests

> reading_time_calculation() => 0

> reading_time_calculation(200) => 1

> reading_time_calculation(1000) => 5

> reading_time_calculation(3000) => 15
